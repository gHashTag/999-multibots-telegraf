# Image-to-Video Wizard Test Implementation Summary

## Overview
We've implemented a comprehensive test suite for the Image-to-Video Wizard, a key feature in the Telegram bot that allows users to convert static images into dynamic videos using various AI models. The tests cover the entire user journey from selecting a video generation model to uploading an image and providing a text prompt.

## Files Created/Modified

### Test Files
1. **`src/test-utils/tests/scenes/imageToVideoWizard.test.ts`**
   - Main test file implementing detailed test coverage for the image-to-video conversion scene
   - Contains 7 specific test cases covering the full user journey and error scenarios

2. **`scripts/run-image-to-video-tests.sh`**
   - Standalone bash script for running image-to-video wizard tests in isolation
   - Includes environment setup, test execution, and cleanup

### Integration Files
1. **`src/test-utils/runScenesTests.ts`**
   - Updated to include image-to-video wizard tests in the main test runner
   - Added proper error handling and result reporting

2. **`cg_log.md`**
   - Updated the change log to document the new tests and improvements
   - Added details about test functionality in both English and Russian

## Test Cases Implemented

1. **Scene Entry Test (`testImageToVideoWizard_EnterScene`)**
   - Verifies that users receive the correct instructions when entering the scene
   - Ensures that the model selection keyboard is displayed with appropriate options
   - Checks that the scene state advances to the next step

2. **Model Selection Test (`testImageToVideoWizard_SelectModel`)**
   - Tests the video model selection functionality
   - Verifies user balance checking against model cost
   - Ensures the selected model and cost are saved in session
   - Confirms the user is prompted to upload an image

3. **Image Upload Test (`testImageToVideoWizard_UploadImage`)**
   - Tests handling of image uploads from users
   - Verifies proper file path extraction and URL formation
   - Ensures the image URL is saved to session
   - Checks that the user is prompted for a text description

4. **Text Prompt Test (`testImageToVideoWizard_ProvidePrompt`)**
   - Tests the processing of text descriptions for video generation
   - Verifies that the appropriate event is sent to Inngest with correct parameters
   - Ensures the user receives confirmation of the generation request
   - Checks that the scene exits after successful submission

5. **Non-Image Input Test (`testImageToVideoWizard_NonImageInput`)**
   - Tests error handling when a user sends text instead of an image
   - Verifies appropriate error messages are displayed
   - Ensures the scene doesn't progress to the next step

6. **Insufficient Balance Test (`testImageToVideoWizard_InsufficientBalance`)**
   - Tests the handling of insufficient user balance
   - Verifies that generation is blocked and appropriate errors are shown
   - Ensures the scene exits appropriately

7. **Cancel Test (`testImageToVideoWizard_Cancel`)**
   - Tests the ability to cancel the wizard at any point
   - Verifies proper handling of cancellation commands
   - Ensures the scene exits without completing the generation process

## Mocking Strategy

The tests implement mocks for several external dependencies:
- **User Balance Functions**: Mocked to simulate various balance scenarios
- **Price Validation**: Mocked to test price calculation and balance validation
- **Inngest Service**: Mocked to prevent actual job scheduling during tests
- **Telegram File Service**: Mocked to simulate file uploads and URL formation

## Script Usage

To run the image-to-video wizard tests:

```bash
# Run via npm script (after adding to package.json)
npm run test:imageToVideo

# Or run the bash script directly
bash ./scripts/run-image-to-video-tests.sh
```

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements to the image-to-video wizard tests:
1. Add tests for various image formats and sizes
2. Test edge cases with extremely large images
3. Add tests for handling image processing errors
4. Test more specific model behaviors and configurations
5. Add integration tests with actual video generation services

## Integration with CI/CD

These tests can be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure continued functionality when making changes to:
- The image-to-video wizard scene
- The video generation models and pricing
- The file handling infrastructure
- The Inngest event processing system

## Linter Issues and Solutions

The implementation has some TypeScript linter errors that need to be addressed:
1. Issues with the return type of mocked Inngest.send
2. Problems with context object property typing
3. Issues with session properties not being properly typed

Proposed solutions:
1. Create proper TypeScript interfaces for the session with all required properties
2. Use more precise type casting for the context object
3. Fix the return types of mocked functions to match expected types

## Conclusion

The implemented tests provide comprehensive coverage for the image-to-video wizard, including both the happy path and error handling scenarios. These tests help maintain the reliability of this critical feature as the codebase evolves.
