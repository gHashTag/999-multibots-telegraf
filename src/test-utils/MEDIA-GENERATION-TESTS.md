## Key Insights from Testing 💡

1. **API Isolation**: Properly isolating external API dependencies has proven critical for reliable test execution without requiring actual service connections.

2. **Localization Testing**: Comprehensive testing across both Russian and English interfaces has uncovered several edge cases in text formatting and button layouts.

3. **Payment Integration**: Early testing of payment flows has identified several potential issues with credits tracking and balance verification.

4. **Edge Case Coverage**: Focusing on timeout scenarios, cancellation flows, and error conditions has significantly improved the overall stability of media generation features.

5. **Reusable Patterns**: The patterns established for NeuroPhoto testing have proven highly reusable for other media generation features, accelerating test development.
