## 2023-12-XX - Testing Framework Improvements

### Added
- Fixed TypeScript linter errors in `checkBalanceScene.test.ts`
- Updated test file to match project conventions with async/await pattern
- Replaced magic strings and numbers with constants
- Fixed type assertions for mocked functions
- Added proper error handling for tests

### Created
- Added new test file `paymentScene.test.ts` with comprehensive test cases for the payment scene:
  - Test for scene entry
  - Test for handling pre-selected payments
  - Test for processing star payments
  - Test for subscription purchases
  - Test for ruble payments
  - Test for returning to main menu
- Implemented full test suite for `startScene` replacing test stubs:

  - Test for transition to main menu
  - Test for subscription scene transition
  - Test for error handling with missing user ID

  - Test for returning to main menu
  - Test for handling unknown modes
  - Test for error handling

### Updated
- Modified the test runner to include payment scene tests

- Improved test clarity with descriptive messages and better error handling
- Enhanced mocking approach for complex scene interactions

### Next Steps
- Add additional test coverage for other critical scenes like subscriptionScene
- Refine mocking strategies for database and external API calls
- Improve error handling and feedback in tests
- Add more test cases for edge conditions
- Address TypeScript linter errors in test files
- Implement integration tests between related scenes
