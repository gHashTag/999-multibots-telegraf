## 2023-10-20

### Initial Assessment
- Found over 100 TypeScript errors in the project
- Most errors are related to test files in `src/test-utils/`
- Main application files had a few errors that have been fixed:
  - Fixed null check issue in `src/services/openai-service.ts`
  - Fixed function parameter issues in `src/scenes/audioToTextScene/handlers.ts`

2. Install missing type definitions
3. Address testing framework issues
4. Fix errors in test utilities and mock implementations

### Completed

- ✅ Installed `@types/jest` to resolve test-related type errors
- ✅ Fixed isRussian test implementation

### In Progress
