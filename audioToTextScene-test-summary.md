# Audio-to-Text Scene Test Implementation Summary

## Overview
As part of our comprehensive testing initiative for the Telegram bot, we've implemented a full suite of tests for the Audio-to-Text conversion scene. This scene allows users to transcribe audio and video files using various Whisper models, with options for language selection and accuracy settings.

## Files Created/Modified

### Test Files
1. **`src/test-utils/tests/scenes/audioToTextScene.test.ts`**
   - Main test file implementing comprehensive test coverage for the audio-to-text scene
   - Contains 6 specific test cases covering the full user journey

2. **`scripts/run-audio-to-text-tests.sh`**
   - Standalone bash script for running audio-to-text scene tests in isolation
   - Includes environment setup, test execution, and cleanup

### Integration Files
1. **`src/test-utils/runScenesTests.ts`**
   - Updated to include audio-to-text scene tests in the main test runner
   - Added proper error handling and result reporting

2. **`cg_log.md`**
   - Updated the change log to document the new tests and improvements
   - Added details about test functionality in both English and Russian

## Test Cases Implemented

1. **Scene Entry Test (`testAudioToTextScene_EnterScene`)**
   - Verifies that users receive the correct instructions when entering the scene
   - Ensures that the session is properly initialized with default values

2. **Audio File Processing Test (`testAudioToTextScene_ProcessAudioFile`)**
   - Tests the bot's ability to receive and process audio files
   - Validates extraction of file metadata (duration, file ID, etc.)
   - Confirms that transcription settings options are presented to the user

3. **Language Selection Test (`testAudioToTextScene_SelectLanguage`)**
   - Tests the language selection functionality (Auto-detect, Russian, English)
   - Verifies that the selected language is properly saved in the session
   - Ensures appropriate feedback is given to the user upon selection

4. **Model Selection Test (`testAudioToTextScene_SelectModel`)**
   - Tests the model selection functionality (Whisper Tiny, Base, Small, Medium, Large)
   - Validates that the selected model is saved in the session
   - Checks for appropriate user feedback

5. **Transcription Process Test (`testAudioToTextScene_StartTranscription`)**
   - Tests the complete transcription initiation process
   - Verifies balance checking and cost calculation
   - Validates the creation of the transcription job via Inngest
   - Ensures proper user feedback about the ongoing process

6. **Insufficient Balance Test (`testAudioToTextScene_InsufficientBalance`)**
   - Tests the error handling when a user has insufficient balance
   - Ensures appropriate error messages are shown
   - Confirms that the transcription does not proceed and the user is returned to the main menu

## Mocking Strategy

The tests implement mocks for several external dependencies:
- **User Balance Functions**: Mocked to simulate both sufficient and insufficient balance scenarios
- **Database Functions**: Mocked to prevent actual database operations during testing
- **Inngest Service**: Mocked to prevent actual job scheduling during tests
- **File Service**: Mocked to simulate file upload and retrieval operations

## Script Usage

To run the audio-to-text scene tests:

```bash
# Run via npm script
npm run test:audioToText

# Or run the bash script directly
bash ./scripts/run-audio-to-text-tests.sh
```

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements to the audio-to-text scene tests:
1. Add tests for various audio formats (MP3, WAV, OGG, etc.)
2. Test more edge cases like very long audio files
3. Add tests for handling malformed audio files
4. Test the actual processing of transcription results
5. Add tests for export functionality in different formats

## Integration with CI/CD

These tests can be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure continued functionality when making changes to:
- The audio-to-text scene handlers
- The text processing pipeline
- The user balance and payment systems
- The Inngest job processing system

## Conclusion

The implemented tests provide comprehensive coverage for the audio-to-text scene, including both the happy path and error handling scenarios. These tests will help maintain functionality as the codebase evolves and ensure that users can reliably convert their audio and video to text.
